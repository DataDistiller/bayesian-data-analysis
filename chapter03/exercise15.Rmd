### The question
Question 15: Joint distributions: The autoregressive time-series model $y_1$, $y_2$, $\dots$ with mean level $0$,
autocorrelation $0.8$, residual standard deviation $1$, and normal errors can be written as
$$(y_t |y_{t−1} , y_{t−2} , \dots) \sim N(0.8y_{t−1} , 1) \qquad \mbox{ for all $t$}$$.

(a) Prove that the distribution of $y_t$ , given the observations at all other integer time points
$t$, depends only on $y_{t−1}$ and $y_{t+1}$ .

(b) What is the distribution of $y_t$ given $y_{t-1}$ and $y_{t+1}$ ?

_This answer is just for part (a) of question 15. Also, it's very much a work-in-progress as we try to make it clear and correct_

### some notation

First define some notation to make things more concise.
Define $\yy_{a..b}$ as a vector of all $y_i$ with $a \ge i \gt b$.
This allows us to say:

$$ \PP{\yy_{1..t}} = \PP{y_t, y_{t-1}, \dots, y_2, y_1} $$

### conditional probability

$$
\PP{A | B, C} = \frac{\PP{A, B, C}}{\PP{B,C}}
$$
Next, note that
$$\PP{B, C} = \int \PP{A,B,C} \dd A
$$
and therefore
$$
\PP{A | B, C} = \frac{\PP{A, B, C}}{\int \PP{A,B,C} \dd A}
$$

### part(a)

The question discusses "all other integer time points".
We define $n$ as an arbitrarily large integer much greater than $t+1$.
We can't easily reason about "all" time points, as there are infinitely many;
but we can consider large $n$ as $n \rightarrow \infty$.

We begin with the joint density over "all" time points:
$$
	\PP{\yy_{1..n}} = \PP{y_n, y_{n−1} , y_{n−2}, \dots, y_{t+1}, y_t, y_{t-1} , \dots, y_1}
$$

Using the formula above for conditional probability:
$$
	\PP{y_t | \yy_{1..t-1}, \yy_{t+1..n}} = \frac{\PP{\yy_{1..n}}}{\int \dd y_t ~ \PP{\yy_{1..n}}}
$$

We can use the gaussian density in the question to expand:
$$
\PP{\yy_{1..n}} = \PP{y_1} \prod_{i=2}^n \NN{y_i|0.8 y_{i-1}, 1}
$$
Substituting this into
$$
	\PP{y_t | \yy_{1..t-1}, \yy_{t+1..n}} = \frac{\PP{\yy_{1..n}}}{\int \dd y_t ~ \PP{\yy_{1..n}}}
$$
we get
$$
	\PP{y_t | \yy_{1..t-1}, \yy_{t+1..n}} = \frac{\PP{y_1} \prod_{i=2}^n \NN{y_i|0.8 y_{i-1}, 1}}{\int \dd y_t ~ \PP{y_1} \prod_{i=2}^n \NN{y_i|0.8 y_{i-1}, 1}}
$$
Factors that don't use $y_t$ can be brought outside the integral:
$$
	\PP{y_t | \yy_{1..t-1}, \yy_{t+1..n}} = \frac{\PP{y_1} \prod_{i=2}^n \NN{y_i|0.8 y_{i-1}, 1}}{\PP{y_1} ~ \left( \prod_{i=2}^{t-1} \NN{y_i|0.8 y_{i-1}, 1}\right) \left(\prod_{i=t+1}^n \NN{y_i|0.8 y_{i-1}, 1}\right) \left(\int \dd y_t ~ \NN{y_t|0.8 y_{t-1}, 1} \NN{y_{t+1}|0.8 y_t, 1}\right)}
$$
The factors that were just moved out can be cancelled against the same factors in the numerator:
$$
	\PP{y_t | \yy_{1..t-1}, \yy_{t+1..n}} = \frac{\NN{y_t|0.8 y_{t-1}, 1} \NN{y_{t+1}|0.8 y_t, 1}}{\int \dd y_t ~ \NN{y_t|0.8 y_{t-1}, 1} \NN{y_{t+1}|0.8 y_t, 1}}
$$

That final expression includes terms for $y_{t+1}$, $y_t$ and $y_{t-1}$, but nothing else.
Therefore part (a) is shown.

### part (b)

For part b, I think we can model $(y_{t+1}, y_t)$ as a bivariate normal,
parameterized in terms of $y_{t-1}$, and use  equation 3.14).
TODO: part b!
