# Summary

* We read sections 1.3 and 1.4, and solved the first exercise of the chapter. 

* These topics in particular came up:

  1. Why does the last equality of equation 1.4 (page 7) hold? In other words, why is $\tilde y$ independent of $y$ conditional on $\theta$? 

  2. Suppose you have two normal random variables $\theta_i \sim \normal(\mu_i, \sigma_i)$, $i = 1, 2$, with corresponding probability density functions $p_i$. Let $c \in (0, 1)$. What's the difference between the probability density function of $\theta := c \theta_1 + (1 - c) \theta_2$ and the probability density function $p := cp_1 + (1 - c)p_2$?

  3. What is marginalisation?

  4. What's the difference between a probability and a probability density?

* We had some volunteers to prepare exercises for the next session on 11th April:

  * Exercise 2: SÃ¶ren
  * Exercise 3: Corrie
  * Exercise 4: Salma
  * Exercise 5: Amin
  * Exercise 6: Tiago
  * Exercise 7: Prasana
  * Exercise 8: Janders
  * Exercise 9: Ayan
